                    <p class="primary">Our research seeks a predictive understanding of biomolecular dynamics and mechanisms that underlie biological function and shape evolution.

                        <br>
                    We are bringing together data science, deep learning, and NMR spectroscopy. <br> Deep learning: a 10,000-ft view of all known data and patterns. <br> NMR: an intimate view of biomolecules' motions, interactions, and timing.

                        <br>
                    We are based at UW-Madison <a href="https://biochem.wisc.edu/">Biochemistry</a><br>and affiliated with <a href="https://biostat.wiscweb.wisc.edu/">Biostatistics and Medical Informatics</a></a>.
